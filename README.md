This is a project that uses Vue (frontend) + .NET (backend). This was a short collab project that was done in between work, with my colleague.
Both of us didn't had prior experience with VueNET framework. This was also done very spontaneously and did not had proper work management (which is something both of us need to work with, so coding is a bit of a mess and project is somewhat abandoned)

To run frontend (Vue)
1. npm run dev

To run backend (.NET)
1. dotnet run
